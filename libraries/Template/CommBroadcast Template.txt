//Note: Since COMM Broadcast is designed to take any messages from which ever Arduino and route it back to COMM then out to CMNC, then take any PC USB output messages and transmit them via the internal network between COMM, NAVI, AUXI, and MAIN, and have it be routed back to COMM and out through CMNC instead of each of the local PC USBs of each Arduino.
