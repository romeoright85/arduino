State Machine - AUXI
===========================================



RoverProgram_AUXI.ino 
	RoverHeathAndStatus (takes in temp, voltage, photo, and current data and determines if the system needs to shut down or can continue) - Finite State Machine
		Use a State Design Pattern for the hold state. When there is reading on one of the sensors that require attention.
		
[IFNISH CODING OBJECTS BELOW, unless noted]

>UpTime (needs to be used along with the Gas Sensor on AUXI's mux channels. tracks the time since the last software reset, the time since it was turned on/last hardware reset)
>>DelayCounter
>>>GlobalDelayTimer

IrDistanceSensor

ImuSensor (not really a class but functions)
>StopWatch
>>GlobalDelayTimer (also used above)
>>DelayCounter (also used above)

State Machine - MAIN
===========================================


RoverProgram_MAIN.ino
	RoverCaptain - Finite State Machine (considers and prioritizes input from the RoverNavigator and RoutePlanner, and RoverHeathAndStatus and decides which heading the rover should go and for how long, then it sends commands to RoverNavigator_NAVI)
