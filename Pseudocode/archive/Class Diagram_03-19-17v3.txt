ALSO NEED TO DO:
MAIN
NAVI
AUXI

Note: Each type of arduino may need different states and modes.

most likely, have each data share pushed automatically to the destination arduino (to minimize network traffic for requests)
have a mode for each type of data share and rotate between the modes under normal circumstances
Also the system won't pull fresh required data, since this will just slow the system down and it will not be fresh by the time it gathers everything anyways.
	instead data will always be pushed to the destination and refreshed automatically. and when the destination needs to use data, it will use whatever data it has already stored/registered, even if it's slightly old.



i.e.
secure link is only for comm?
navigation algoritms for navi
redirection for main
auxi controls for auxi
etc.

==================
Note: These states don't always have to go in order.
Note: *begin* means this is one of the starting points for this mode

POWER_ON_RESET
INITIALIZATION
SYNCHRONIZATION					
SECURING_LINK						
NORMAL_OPERATIONS						
HW_RESETTING
SYSTEM_SLEEPING
SW_RESETTING
SYSTEM_ERROR
SYSTEM_STANDBY (like go to sleep, except COMM stays away and uses PIR to wake up the other arduinos)
		
==================
Command Options (i.e. used in the PROCESS_DATA state. Typically from the NORMAL_OPERATIONS mode, but not always)
==================	
Note: With external commands, you only want to do all hw or all sw request (and not individual hw/sw requests). Else the system won't be in sync anymore. So hw/sw requests must be synced and have controlled points of entry.
	But interally, it may call individual commands as required.
Note: With external commands, you only want to do all sleep requests (and not individual sleep requests). Else the system won't be in sync anymore. So sleep requests must be synced and have controlled points of entry.

		System Go
			if communications_secure = false
				Mode: SECURING_LINK *begin*
				cmnc_msg_queue = SYSTEM_READY_STATUS (tells CMNC it's ready for a secure link)
			else
				Mode: NORMAL_OPERATIONS *begin*
			end if
			timeout_counter = 0 (for future use)				
		System Ready
			main_system_ready = true (so it can stop checking for this message since the MAIN system is known to be ready)
			timeout_counter = 0 (for future use)		
			main_msg_queue = SYSTEM_READY_STATUS (tells MAIN it's ready to synchronize)
		Establish Secure Link
			Mode: NORMAL_OPERATIONS *begin*
			timeout_counter = 0
		Break Secure Link
			Mode: SECURING_LINK *begin*
			timeout_counter = 0
			communications_secure = false
		HW Reset Request
			Mode: HW_RESETTING *begin*
			main_msg_queue == COMM_HW_RESET_REQUEST					
			cmnc_msg_queue == HW_RESETTING			
		All SW Reset Request
			Mode: SW_RESETTING *begin*	
			main_msg_queue == ALL_SW_RESET_REQUEST
			cmnc_msg_queue == SW_RESETTING			
		All Sleep Request
			Mode: SYSTEM_SLEEPING *begin*
			main_msg_queue == ALL_SLEEP_REQUEST
			cmnc_msg_queue == SYSTEM_SLEEPING								
		PIR Status
			cmnc_msg_queue or main_msg_queue (based on the requester) = PIR_STATUS
			Note: The PIR status message will be created in the CREATE_DATA state
		COMM SW Reset Request (usually from MAIN):
			Next State: RUN_HOUSEKEEPING_TASKS
			Mode: INITIALIZATION *begin*
		COMM Sleep Request (usually from MAIN):
			Mode: SYSTEM_WAKING *begin*
			main_msg_queue == ALL_WAKE_REQUEST					
			cmnc_msg_queue == SYSTEM_WAKING			
			Run pre-sleep tasks. (i.e. end software serial, as needed)
			Put COMM to sleep
				Don't switch states yet. Go to sleep in the current PROCESS_DATA state.
			The Xbee/Serial will wake up the sleep.
			Run wake up tasks. (i.e. begin SW serial as needed, etc.)
			Then it will go to RUN_HOUSEKEEPING_TASKS, while in SYSTEM_WAKING
				Then it will go to the next state, which is set will default to CONTROL_OUTPUTS

			

			
IMPROVEMENT TIP: Maybe add system hold and system standby states later if have time.
