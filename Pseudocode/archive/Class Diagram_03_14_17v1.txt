State Machine - AUXI
===========================================



RoverProgram_AUXI.ino 
	RoverHeathAndStatus (takes in temp, voltage, photo, and current data and determines if the system needs to shut down or can continue) - Finite State Machine
		Use a State Design Pattern for the hold state. When there is reading on one of the sensors that require attention.

>UpTime (needs to be used along with the Gas Sensor on AUXI's mux channels. tracks the time since the last software reset, the time since it was turned on/last hardware reset)

State Machine - MAIN
===========================================


RoverProgram_MAIN.ino
	RoverCaptain - Finite State Machine (considers and prioritizes input from the RoverNavigator and RoutePlanner, and RoverHeathAndStatus and decides which heading the rover should go and for how long, then it sends commands to RoverNavigator_NAVI)

State Matrix Design = States vs. Modes			
==================
States
==================
Note: These states don't always have to go in order.
	RUN_HOUSEKEEPING_TASKS
		runs in parallel with every loop
	RX_COMMUNICATIONS
	DATA_VALIDATION
		data parsing and validation
		validateData()
	DATA_FILTER
		dataDirector()
	READ_INPUTS
	PROCESS_DATA
	CONTROL_OUTPUTS			
	CREATE_DATA
	TX_COMMUNICATIONS		
==================
Modes
==================
Note: These states don't always have to go in order.
POWER_ON_RESET
INITIALIZATION
SYNCHRONIZATION					
SECURING_LINK						
NORMAL_OPERATIONS						
HW_RESETTING
SYSTEM_SLEEPING
SYSTEM_WAKING
SW_RESETTING
	Same as INITIALIZE, just giving it an alias name for ease of reading
SYSTEM_HOLDING
SYSTEM_ERROR
SYSTEM_STANDBY (like go to sleep, except COMM stays away and uses PIR to wake up the other arduinos)
		
==================
Possible Commands from MAIN to COMM
==================		
Break Secure Link
	Next State: CONTROL_OUTPUTS
	Mode: SECURING_LINK
	timeout_counter = 0
	secure_link_error = false
	go to RUN_HOUSEKEEPING_TASKS
