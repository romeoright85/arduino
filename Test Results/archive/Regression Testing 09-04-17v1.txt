Note: Don't use a USB hub with the laptop. Even when the Arduino is connected to it, it will have issues for some reason.

Note: When programming the Arduinos, make sure power to all other Arduinos are there by connecting the Rover's USB cables to all the Arduinos to power them. Else you might not be able to get a Done uploading message.
=========NEED TO DO=========

still need to test xbee and anything connected to navi and auxi to make sure nothing else was fried. though it seemed to burn the chip quick

		Heading works.
		Some reason Roll, Pitch, Yaw and AHRS outputs all zeros. Could be the code and not the device itself. May need to debug later.

	
	IrDistanceSensorTest
	irDistanceRearCenter isn't working for some reason. It's not changing with distance.
		After probing around and injecting voltages, it seem to work again without anything changed. Weird but ok.
	[future improvement idea]Can change from average to median filter.

[nah just run all tests]determine what pins might have had high voltage and how it may have impacted electronics down the line on the navi and mega

Tester the Laser code on AUXI with all others on COMMBroadcast and it works. (no xbee used, just COMM to USB though)
