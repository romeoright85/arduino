IrDistanceSensor
	Updated code 12-31-16v2:
		Just reorder the sensor sampling from front, right, back left.
	Retest Comments:
		Works great!
	
	
	
DigitalLedTester
	Updated code 12-31-16:
		In DigitalLed.cpp
		Found error:
			digitalWrite(this->_ledIsOn, LOW);
		Should be:
			digitalWrite(this->_ledPin, LOW);
		In TailLightAssembly.cpp
		Found error:
		No objects were instantiated in the constructor.
		So updated to instantiate objects			
	Retest Comments:
		Just needed to update the counter type from unsigned int to unsigned long. Else works great.

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
DigitalLedTester
	Reran code with no updates.
	Retest Comments:
	Taillights not working.
	The other lights turn on, but not off.
	
	

LaserControlTester
Remember to move the jumper over to enable the laser.
	Write test code 12-31-16:
		Enabled both lasers to see if there's something wrong with the hardware or the OOP code.
	Retest Comments:
		Test code at first didn't work.
		Probed and measured around. Then it work.
		Must have been a loose wire or something.
		Revert to the original code.
		One laser is brighter than the other. Oh well.
	
	
IrDistanceSensor
	Updated code 12-31-16:
		Take several readings and average.	
		Added debug options, and simulated the data in software.
	Retest Comments:
		Works great. Just reorder the sensor sampling from front, right, back left.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
UltrasonicSensorTester
	Updated code 12-31-16:
		Fixed config pins to use A0, A1, etc. since they're analog pins.
		Take several readings and average.	
		Added debug options, and simulated the data in software.
	Retest Comments:
		Works great!
	

PirSensorTester	
	Updated code 12-31-16:
		Added Reset
	Retest Comments:
		Works well. Doesn't always catch every motion, but good enough.

Note:
Make sure you upload the code to the right arduino.
Make sure to clear out all other Arduinos of any reset (HW or SW) testers before you run your new code or it might reset and you might be confused as what is going on.
Make sure all USBs are plugged into all the Arduinos during testing. You can unplug them for programming, but plug them back in when you use it in order to have enough power.





Write a universal blank IDE to upload to clear out the program in any arduino.

DigitalLedTester
NEEDS TROUBLESHOOTING
Some reason it flashes really quick. Also the serial stops outputting when the 5V power switch is on.
	Update 12-31-16: Need to plug in USB for other Arduinos when not using them in order to power them.
Maybe try to use delay() instead of loop. And flash some at a time at a slower rate.
Had a hard time uploading to NAVI. Had to turn off the 5V SW power and just use the USB power to upload to it.



AnalogLedTester
Comments:
NEEDS TROUBLESHOOTING
	Some reason it only works when the USB is plugged in.
	
	
	
HwResetTester_COMM
HwResetTester_MAIN
Comments:
	Done run the MAIN and COMM code at the same time as they will interrupt and reset each other.
	NEEDS REWORK
	Write new extra code for MAIN, NAVI, AUXI, COMM to print any text. Then monitor with anther usb/terminal as you HW reset with the other Arduino.



CurrentSensorControlTester (Current Faults and Resets)
Comments:
	For some reason when the 5V switched power is off no fault is detected, but when you turn it on, it faults constantly and resets constantly.
	
	
	
	
	
MotorAndServoTester_MAIN
MotorAndServoTester_NAVI
Comments:
	Software isn't working as expected. Getting no movement on motors and servo jitter.
	Try to write it where I can use two usb/terminals to send control signals, enable, read encoders, etc.


WakeUpTester_AUXI
WakeUpTester_NAVI
WakeUpTester_MAIN	
WakeUpTester_COMM
Comments:
	All four of this code needs to be uploaded in a set.
	Use at least USB cords and two terminals.
	One to monitor Arduino going to sleep and the other to control the sleep/wake.
	
	NEEDS REWORK
		Write new extra code for MAIN, NAVI, AUXI, COMM to print any text. Then monitor with anther usb/terminal as you HW reset with the other Arduino.

		Update comment for COMM to type any key to wake it up.
		AUXI not waking after going to sleep.
		MAIN not waking after going to sleep.
		NAVI doesn't sleep at all.
		

		
		
		
		
		
	

IrDistanceSensor
Comments:
	NEEDS REWORK
	Works okay but not very accurate.
	Need to take several samples and average.

PirSensorTester
	Comments:
	NEEDS REWORK
	Once motion is detected, it stays latched for some reason.
	Fix:
		Do a pirSensor.reset() once you read in the data.
